# Clustering
In this project there are revised different clustering methods:
 - k-means
 - Affinity propagation
 - Spectral clustering
 - Agglomerative clustering
 - DBSCAN
 
Also, there are revised methods that help us define the optimal number of clusters:
 - Elbow method
 - Silhoutte method
 - The Gap statistic

The data comes from different wine offering campaigns. The goal is to reveal patterns in those offerings.
